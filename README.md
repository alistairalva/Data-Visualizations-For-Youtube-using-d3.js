# Dynamic Charts to visualize raw Youtube Data
## Made with, Vanilla javascript, d3.js, HTML & CSS

### This is a project showing interactive, dynamic charts using d3.js. 
This project has **NO external dependencies** apart from d3.js. This is written in  pure javascript with no external libraries and frameworks.
- To run this project you would have to start your own server. You can use either XAMPP or any other easy to set up server. Alternatively you can also download the live server extension if you're using Visual Studio Code and start a server directly on the `dashboard.js` file.

**This project is under revision and I am going to overhaul this whole project with realtime data from the youtube API and make it return live real-time data. Stay tuned**
